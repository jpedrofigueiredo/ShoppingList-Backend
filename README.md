# ShoppingList Backend
This project was forked from the [original API backend server by GroundApps](https://github.com/GroundApps/ShoppingList_Backend)

##Installation

###Requirements
* PHP >= 5.3.7
* Apache Websever (we recommend a TLS Connection to the Server)
* MySQL or SQLite (you can select in the Install Script)

###Database
You can either use MySQL or SQLite. SQLite is easier to set up.

###Installation on the web server
1. Clone and checkout the code into a directory in your web server.
2. Navigate to http://yourserver/folder/INSTALL.php to choose the DB configuration and secret key.
3. Configure ShoppingList for Android to point to your server and use the same secret key on the API server.
4. When everything is working, remove INSTALL.php from the server.
